a corpus of Estonian regilaul folk songs from the Estonian Folklore Archives:

this repository contains audio files, corresponding tempo maps, txt files of lyrics, and the scripts used to annotate and analyze the acoustic correlates of stress in ictus and off-ictus position in the songs. 

I made extensive use of the praatio library in manipulating the textgrids. thanks, praatio. Tim Mahrt. PraatIO. https://github.com/timmahrt/praatIO, 2016.

Could be modified to study other songs in other languages. 

For tempo mapping tutorial: (to come)
if you want to see the spectrograms with the textgrids, download the audio and grid files and view them in PRAAT: https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/
